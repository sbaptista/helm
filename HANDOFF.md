## Last Session Completed

**2026-08-29 — HELM-71 shared 3×5 card header compaction (Codex GPT-5.6 Sol) — v00.03.0007**

1. Confirmed through browser geometry that front and rear 3×5 cards use identical dimensions and padding.
2. Reduced the shared card title from `14.7px` to `13.3px`, matching the date/subtitle and freeing vertical space across every card category.
3. Preserved the established 5×3-inch capture geometry, footer, watermark, content sizing, and Epson-tested outer margins.
4. Database impact: none.

## Uncommitted Changes

- None. HELM-71 and the v00.03.0007 release documentation are included in the local commit prepared on 2026-08-29.

## Key Decisions

- **Dashboard is CRUD hub**: All trip management happens on the dashboard. Trip detail view is read-only + import + calendar.
- **Trip status lifecycle**: Draft → Upcoming → Active → Archived. Upcoming = confirmed but not yet traveling.
- **force-dynamic on mutation pages**: Any page where client actions mutate data and calls `router.refresh()` must export `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`.
- **Version bump = production push**: Every version change ships. No version exists only in dev.
- **Auth shell variant system**: Variant A (navy + stars + wheel) is default. Variant B preserved via DEV toggle.
- **Service worker**: network-first for navigation, cache-first for static assets. Disabled in development.
- **Dev bypass**: server-side `BYPASS_AUTH_USER_ID` + login form `dev@dev.local`. Both disappear in production.
- **Branching**: Currently working on main directly. May evolve to feature branches merged to main for production — same version/push principle applies.
- **Scroll-to-first-error pattern**: Shared utility in `lib/form-utils.ts` finds first `role="alert"` inside the active `role="dialog"` and scrolls into view. All edit forms use toast + scrollToFirstError() on validation failure.
- **Help button over settings page**: What's New lives in a ResponsiveSheet opened from Help button. Extensible for future sections without committing to a full settings page.
- **Update banner at very top**: Fixed above header (z-index 110 > header 100), header offsets down via `onVisibilityChange` callback + `BANNER_HEIGHT` constant.
- **Centralized section types**: `types/sections.ts` defines typed interfaces for all DB section tables. Import from there instead of using `any` for Supabase query results.
- **Calendar lifecycle**: included dirty records create/update events; excluded dirty records delete any stored remote events before clearing IDs and dirty state.
- **Calendar authority**: a stored Google calendar ID is only a pointer; Google CalendarList validation determines whether the calendar still exists and is accessible.
- **Flight time contract**: Helm displays airport-local time with its date-correct timezone abbreviation. Persist and sync the real instant computed from local date/time plus IANA timezone; calendar applications render that instant in the viewer's active timezone.
- **Timezone selector identity**: one option per stored IANA identifier; cities sharing identical rules use a combined label rather than duplicate values.
- **TBD timing identity**: `day_id` attaches an item to a dated itinerary day; a non-all-day null `start_time` intentionally represents Time TBD.
- **Clear means rebuild**: Clear Calendar deletes Google events, removes obsolete event IDs, and marks every included record dirty for the next Update All.
- **Delete means pending Calendar removal**: soft-deleted linked records remain dirty tombstones until Update All removes remote events and clears their stored IDs.
- **One print data boundary**: Both 8.5×11 packets and 3×5 cards load data through the authenticated print route. Exact-size cards retain the validated `html2canvas` → `jsPDF` engine and Epson-tested margins.

## Next Priorities

1. Stan continues recreating the Itinerary and reports issues as encountered.
2. Run Calendar Update All and verify the deleted `Arrive SEA` event is removed and the currently checked Itinerary record is recreated.
3. Activate the remaining intended Add to Google Calendar checkboxes, then verify complete event creation/deletion behavior.
4. Stan verifies all six 3×5 PDF categories and physical Epson output.
5. Resolve the pre-existing `UpdateBanner.tsx` lint error and remaining warning backlog.

---

## Session Rules (always enforce)

- **Permission required before:** any code implementation or build changes.
- **Never `git push` without Stan's explicit in-chat approval.** (Wait for Stan to commit — do not auto-commit).
- **Always bump version** on every local change — no exceptions.
