## Last Session Completed

**2026-08-25 — Daily 3×5 itinerary card dates (Codex GPT-5) — v00.02.0052**

1. Added the itinerary date to the front header of every Daily Itinerary 3×5 card.
2. Formatted dates as compact, legible weekday/month/day labels without changing the back card or itinerary-row capacity.
3. Database impact: none.

---

## Uncommitted Changes

- `components/advisor/print/CardPrintView.tsx` — date shown on each Daily Itinerary 3×5 front card.
- `lib/version.ts`, `lib/changelog.ts`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `HANDOFF.md` — v00.02.0052 release documentation and handoff.

---

## Key Decisions

- **Dashboard is CRUD hub**: All trip management happens on the dashboard. Trip detail view is read-only + import + calendar.
- **Trip status lifecycle**: Draft → Upcoming → Active → Archived. Upcoming = confirmed but not yet traveling.
- **force-dynamic on mutation pages**: Any page where client actions mutate data and calls `router.refresh()` must export `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`.
- **Version bump = production push**: Every version change ships. No version exists only in dev.
- **Auth shell variant system**: Variant A (navy + stars + wheel) is default. Variant B preserved via DEV toggle.
- **Service worker**: network-first for navigation, cache-first for static assets. Disabled in development.
- **Dev bypass**: server-side `BYPASS_AUTH_USER_ID` + login form `dev@dev.local`. Both disappear in production.
- **Branching**: Currently working on main directly. May evolve to feature branches merged to main for production — same version/push principle applies.
- **Scroll-to-first-error pattern**: Shared utility in `lib/form-utils.ts` finds first `role="alert"` inside the active `role="dialog"` and scrolls into view. All edit forms use toast + scrollToFirstError() on validation failure.
- **Help button over settings page**: What's New lives in a ResponsiveSheet opened from Help button. Extensible for future sections without committing to a full settings page.
- **Update banner at very top**: Fixed above header (z-index 110 > header 100), header offsets down via `onVisibilityChange` callback + `BANNER_HEIGHT` constant.
- **Centralized section types**: `types/sections.ts` defines typed interfaces for all DB section tables. Import from there instead of using `any` for Supabase query results.
- **Calendar lifecycle**: included dirty records create/update events; excluded dirty records delete any stored remote events before clearing IDs and dirty state.
- **Calendar authority**: a stored Google calendar ID is only a pointer; Google CalendarList validation determines whether the calendar still exists and is accessible.
- **Flight time contract**: Helm displays airport-local time with its date-correct timezone abbreviation. Persist and sync the real instant computed from local date/time plus IANA timezone; calendar applications render that instant in the viewer's active timezone.
- **Clear means rebuild**: Clear Calendar deletes Google events, removes obsolete event IDs, and marks every included record dirty for the next Update All.
- **One print data boundary**: Both 8.5×11 packets and 3×5 cards load data through the authenticated print route. Exact-size cards retain the validated `html2canvas` → `jsPDF` engine and Epson-tested margins.

## Next Priorities

1. Stan: verify all six 3×5 PDF categories on localhost and confirm physical Epson output preserves the established margins.
2. Test linked Itinerary rows, source deep links, Overview counts, daily cards, and All Day/Estimated behavior on Mac, iPad, and iPhone.
3. Run Calendar Update All and verify each included Flight has one full-duration event, the temporary arrival events are removed, Hotels have two 30-minute events, and unchecking removes stored events.
4. Resolve the pre-existing `UpdateBanner.tsx` lint error and remaining warning backlog.

---

## Session Rules (always enforce)

- **Permission required before:** any code implementation or build changes.
- **Never `git push` without Stan's explicit in-chat approval.** (Wait for Stan to commit — do not auto-commit).
- **Always bump version** on every local change — no exceptions.
